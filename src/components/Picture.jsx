        I'm a third-year Computer Science student who loves coding. Most of the time I investigate new things to learn. Web development is one of my favorite things. Even though Front-end is amazing, Back-end aspects like API development or Database Management are also things I like.

        I also like having a healthy lifestyle, practicing sports like swimming and weightlifting. Hanging out with my friends or spending time with my family is something I wouldn't trade for anything. Traveling is something that I would love to do more because there's a lot that I need to experience.
